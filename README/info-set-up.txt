## Next.js App Router (Client Components):
https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/start/quickstart/nextjs-app-router-client-components/

# Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:
-Node.js v18.17 or later
-npm v9 or later
-git v2.14.1 or later
-You will also need to create an AWS account. Note that AWS Amplify is part of the AWS Free Tier.

Steps to set up -
1. install latest nextjs app (using the App Router)
2. add AWS Amplify inside the app through npm with create-amplify:
	cd <just-created-nextapp>
	npm create amplify@latest - 
		? Where should we create your project? (.) # press enter
		(will scaffold a lightweight Amplify project in your current project by adding a folder `amplify`)
3. start a local dev server for your app development
	npm run dev
4. Now configure your AWS account to use Amplify. 
(Note: If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your local machine, and you have configured the corresponding AWS profile with the AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess permission policy, you can skip this step.)
5. Set up your AWS account (if not)- https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/start/account-setup/
This guide will walk you through how to set up your AWS account and configure an AWS profile locally for use with Amplify.
And it can be done in two way:
	Permanent credentials with an IAM user through the use of access keys (will follow this one as of now)
	Temporary credentials with IAM Identity Center, formerly known as AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
6. Step - Permanent credentials with an IAM user through the use of access keys:
	Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
	Navigate to the IAM Create user page.
	Specify a user name and choose Next.
	Create access key
7. Configure an IAM user:
	npx amplify configure profile --name <IAM user> 
		? Do you already have IAM User credentials? N
			Follow the instructions at https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/ 
			to configure a new Amplify IAM user and credentials(repeat step 6).
		? Hit [enter] when complete
		? Enter Access Key ID:
		? Enter Secret Access Key:
		? Enter the AWS region to use with the 'amplify-dev' profile (eg us-east-1, us-west-2, etc): us-east-1
		Created profile amplify-dev successfully!
8. Bootstrap your AWS account:
Before you can start creating the cloud sandbox environment, Amplify will need to complete a one-time bootstrap setup for the account and AWS Region before it can start deploying resources.
	npx amplify sandbox --profile <IAM user>
	(The given region has not been bootstrapped. Sign in to console as a Root user or Admin to complete the bootstrap process and re-run the amplify sandbox command. )
	During the first-time setup, amplify sandbox will ask you to sign in to the AWS Management Console. 
	Once you're signed in, you will be redirected to the Amplify console. 
	On the Create new app page, choose Initialize setup now.
9. Done! You have successfully completed the bootstrapping process 
and you can now return to the terminal to create a new Amplify sandbox environment:
	npx amplify sandbox --profile <IAM user>
10. You should now have these two commands running concurrently in different terminal windows.
